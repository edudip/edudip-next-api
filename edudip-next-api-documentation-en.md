# edudip next API

**Version 2021-02-05**

## Use case

The edudip next API can be used for programatically control the edudip next functions. The API allows ie to create, read and modify webinars. The API can be used to integrate edudip next webinars into your own website or application.

## General structure

edudip next API is a REST API (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). JSON is used as the format for data exchange.

Each function of the API is represented by a so-called endpoint. Each endpoint consists of an URL, the corresponding HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and optionally a list of required parameters.

In this document we will only specify the path of the endpoint. Each endpoint must therefore always be preceded by ```https://api.edudip-next.com```.

If an endpoint requires a list of parameters, these parameters must be encoded as multipart/form-data (https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#multipart-form-data) or application/x-www-form-urlencoded (https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#urlencoded-form-data).

Each API request must also contain the HTTP header ```Accept``` with the value ```application/json```.

Example of an implementation of a POST request using PHP and cURL:

```
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.edudip-next.com/api/webinars');
$httpHeaders = [
    'Accept: application/json',
    'Authorization: Bearer API-Token',
];
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $httpHeaders);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, 'parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2');
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
var_dump($response);

```

In this example API-Token should be replaced by your personal API token (see Authentication for details).

For all API requests that have been successfully processed, the HTTP status code ```200 OK``` is returned. If an API request fails, an appropriate HTTP status code is returned.

If you are missing functions in the API for integration in your application, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss with you whether this functionality can be added to the API.

All times are specified in the "Europe/Berlin" time zone.

## Reference implementation

At https://github.com/edudip/next-api-client you can download a sample implementation of the edudip next API. This implementation is based on PHP and cURL and can be easily integrated into your project using composer.

## Authentication

### Authenticated requests with API token

All API requests described in this document must be authenticated. So-called API tokens are used to authenticate requests. An API token is an ASCII string with a length of 60 characters. Each API token is assigned to a user in edudip next. Each action that is performed via the API is assigned to a team member via the API token and therefore has the same access rights as this team member.

The API token must be included in every API request as an HTTP header named ```Authorization```:

    Authorization: Bearer [API-TOKEN]

Replace [API-TOKEN] with your generated API token.

API tokens must not be passed on to third parties and should be kept safe. To ensure full security, all API requests must take place via HTTPS.


### Creating API tokens

To generate an API token, please log in to edudip next with your email address and password. Now click on the menu item "Settings" on the left side. Now scroll down until you reach the item "API-Tokens". Now click on the button "Generate another API-Token". The system will now ask you to specify which team member this API token should be assigned to. Select the desired team member and then click on generate “API-Token".

Note: If the item "API-Token" does not appear or you do not have the option of generating an API token, the API has not been activated for your account. In this case please contact sales@edudip.com.

### Modify an existing webinar

**Endpoint:** PUT /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]

Changes the values/settings of an existing webinar. The following parameters can be transferred when calling the endpoint (analogous to HTTP POST requests). It is not necessary to transfer all parameters every time, it is also possible to transfer a subset only:

|Parameter|
|---------|
|title|
|max_participants|
|recording|
|registration_type|
|access|

The meaning and value range of the individual parameters can be found in the description of the endpoint ```GET /api/webinars``` and ```GET /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]```.

In case of success a JSON object is returned, with the property ```success``` with the value ```true```, as well as the property ```webinar``` which contains the modified and updated webinar object.

### Add a new appointment to a webinar

**Endpoint:** POST /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]/add-date

Return in case of success:

    {
         "success": true,
         "date": [Webinar date object]
    }

### Delete existing date of a webinar

**Endpoint:** DELETE /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]/dates/[Webinar-Date-Id]

**Please note** that the last date of a webinar cannot be deleted, i.e. at least one date must exist for each webinar. Furthermore, when a date is deleted, all associated data is also deleted. This includes all recordings and registration data of participants for this date. We therefore recommend that you save all recordings and relevant data before deleting an appointment.

### Register a participant for a webinar

**Endpoint:** POST /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]/register-participant

Registers a participant for the specified webinar. The following POST parameters can be specified when calling the endpoint:

|email|String|✓|Participant's email address|
|firstname|String|✓|Forename of the participant|
|lastname|String|✓|Surname of the participant|
|webinar_date|String|✕|Date in the format ```Y-m-d H:i:s``` (i.g. 2019-12-01 12:30:00), if you wish to register for one date only (if property ```registration_type``` of the webinar is set to ```date`` (single appointment)).|

**Return in case of error:**

     {
        "success": false,

            "fields": [
                // Optional, only if "type" has value "form_validation". Contains an array with fieldnames, that contain invlid or missing values
            ]
        }
     }

**Return in case of success:**

    {
        "success": true,
        "participant": {
            "auth_key": String,
            "firstname": String,
            "lastname": String,
            "updated_at": String, format: Y-m-d H:i:s (i.g. 2019-12-01 12:30:00),
            "created_at": String, format: Y-m-d H:i:s (i.g. 2019-12-01 12:30:00)
        },
        "registeredDates": [
            {
                "date": String, format Y-m-d H:i:s (i.g. 2019-12-01 12:30:00),

                "room_link": String
            }
        ]
    }

The ```auth_key``` field contains the personal authorisation key with which a participant in the room can identify themselves. This key is already inserted in the webinar room link in the ```room_link``` property. The participant accesses the webinar room for the relevant date directly using the ```room_link``` property. Each webinar appointment has its own link. The link is personalised and only intended for this participant.

**Error codes:**

|Code|Meaning|
|----|---------|
|form_validation|One or more registration fields were not filled in or were filled in incorrectly|
|date_missing|Single appointment was selected as registration type, but no appointment was specified for which the participant should be registered|
|date_not_bookable|The specified webinar date (Post parameter "webinar_date") can no longer be booked or is in the past|
|participant_exists|A participant with the specified email address has already been registered|

Deletes all participant data from edudip next. Can be used, for example, to comply with requests in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR regarding the right to deletion. The difference to the endpoint ```POST /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]/cancelRegistration``` is that after de-registration, the participant's data remain stored in the system for further processing.

### Add a moderator to a webinar

**Endpoint:** POST /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]/moderators/add

Adds a new (co)moderator to an existing webinar. Up to three (co)moderators can be added (in addition to the webinar owner). The following parameters must be passed to this endpoint.

        "success": true,
        "attendance": {
        	"max.mustermann@example.com": 12,
	     	"john.doe@example.com": 31,
 			  ...
        }
    }


## Recordings

### List all recordings

**Endpoint** GET /api/recordings

The following GET parameters can be passed to the API endpoint to paginate the results:

|Parameter|Data type|Required|Description|
|----|----|-------|--------|
|offset|Uint|✕|Index of the first element to be output (0 corresponds to the first element of the list)|
|limit|Uint|✕|Number of output elements|


**Please note** that recording takes time and recordings are not available immediately after the webinar. It usually takes about half the time that was taken by the webinar. For this reason, you may need to implement a polling mechanism in your application - depending on the application case - to check for the presence of recordings of a webinar. We recommend a time interval of 10 minutes.

### Output the download URL of a single recording

**Endpoint** GET /api/recordings/[Recording-Id]/download-url

Returns an URL, via which it is possible to download the recording as an MP4 file. The Recording-Id can be read via the endpoint GET /api/records. Please note that the download URLs are only valid for a limited time. Usually the URLs are valid for about 2 hours.

### List recordings of a single webinar

**Endpunkt** GET /api/webinars/[Webinar-Id]/recordings

Reads out all recordings of the specified webinar.
